## How it works

This user module takes an 8-bit input (`ui_in`) and **swaps the upper and lower 4-bit nibbles**. For example, if the input is `0xAB` (where `A` is 1010 and `B` is 1011 in binary), the output will be `0xBA`. The design is purely combinational and does not use the clock (`clk`), reset (`rst_n`), or enable (`ena`) signals.

### Pin Assignments

- **ui_in[7:0]**: The 8-bit input from the TinyTapeout padframe.
- **uo_out[7:0]**: The 8-bit output, which is the nibble-swapped version of `ui_in`.
- **uio_in, uio_out, uio_oe**: Not used in this project (all driven low).

## How to test

1. **Simulation with Cocotb**:
   - Use the provided Verilog testbench (`tb.v`) and cocotb test script (`test_project.py`).
   - Several test vectors (e.g. `0x00`, `0xFF`, `0xA5`, `0xF0`, etc.) are fed into `ui_in`.
   - The cocotb test checks if the output `uo_out` matches the expected nibble-swapped result.

2. **Waveform Viewing** (optional):
   - After running the simulation, open the generated `tb.vcd` file with a viewer like GTKWave to visualize input and output signals over time.

No clock-based or sequential behavior is usedâ€”this is strictly a combinational design.

## External hardware

No external hardware is required for this project. It solely relies on the 8 dedicated input pins and produces an 8-bit output. The additional I/O pins are disabled and driven low, making this design fully self-contained within TinyTapeout.
